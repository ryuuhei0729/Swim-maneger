# Development2 Credentials Key Template
# ================================
#
# This is a template for the development2 credentials key file.
# 
# To use this template:
# 1. Copy this file and rename it to 'development2.key'
# 2. Generate a new Rails credentials key using:
#    rails credentials:new --environment development2
# 3. Replace this content with the generated key
#
# IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES:
# - NEVER commit the actual .key file to version control
# - The .key file should contain a 32-character hexadecimal string
# - Keep the actual key file secure and share it only with authorized team members
# - Use environment variables or secure key management for production
#
# Example format (DO NOT USE THIS ACTUAL KEY):
# 1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
